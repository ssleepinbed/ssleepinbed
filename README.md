<h1> Hello Hello~ </h1>

I'm <b> sleepinbed~</b> Thanks for stopping by. :)

I'm a physics student, and I'm currently getting through a comprehensive programming course. What I know is mostly from practical work but recently I've been working
on formalizing what I know already and fill in the gaps that I don't know so I can move on to advanced things. I love games, and I'd adore to make one!
